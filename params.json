{"name":"Hierarchical and Grouped Time Series","tagline":"hts package for R","body":"# hts\r\n\r\nThe R package *hts* presents functions to create, plot and forecast hierarchical \r\nand grouped time series. In forecasting hierarchical and grouped time series, the \r\nbase methods implemented include ETS, ARIMA and the naive (random walk) models. \r\nForecasts for grouped time series are calibrated using bottom-up and optimal \r\ncombination methods. Forecasts for hierarchical time series are distributed in \r\nthe hierarchy using bottom-up, top-down, middle-out and optimal combination \r\nmethods. Three top-down methods are available: the two Gross-Sohl methods and \r\nthe forecast-proportion approach of Hyndman, Ahmed, and Athanasopoulos (2011).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\nYou can install the **stable** version on \r\n[R CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/package=hts).\r\n\r\n```s\r\ninstall.packages('hts', dependencies = TRUE)\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou can also install the **development** version from\r\n[Github](https://github.com/robjhyndman/gts)\r\n\r\n```s\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"hts\", \"robjhyndman\") \r\n```\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n```s\r\n# library(hts)\r\ndemo(htseg1)  # hts example 1\r\ndemo(htseg2)  # hts example 2\r\ndemo(infantgts)  # gts\r\n```\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\nThis package is free and open source software, licensed under GPL (>= 2).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
